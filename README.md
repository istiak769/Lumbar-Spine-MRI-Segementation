# Pioneering Precision in Lumbar Spine MRI Segmentation with Advanced Deep Learning and Data Enhancement

## Short Description

This project focuses on improving lumbar spine segmentation in MRI using advanced deep learning techniques. By employing a modified U-Net model with innovative architectural enhancements and a custom combined loss function, we address key challenges such as class imbalance and data preprocessing. This approach significantly enhances segmentation accuracy and has potential clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment planning for low back pain.
